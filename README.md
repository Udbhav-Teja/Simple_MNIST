# MNIST Code README

This repository contains code for training and evaluating machine learning models on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits commonly used as a benchmark for image classification tasks.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel image of a handwritten digit (0-9). The dataset is split into two main parts: a training set and a test set.

The dataset can be downloaded from the official MNIST website: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. Please make sure to download the dataset and place it in the appropriate location before running the code.

## Code Structure

The code is organized as follows:

1. `data_loader.py`: This file contains functions to load the MNIST dataset into memory. It provides functions to load both the training and test sets, as well as functions to preprocess the data if needed.

2. `model.py`: This file defines the structure of the machine learning model. It contains the code for building the neural network architecture used for training and inference.

3. `train.py`: This file is responsible for training the model using the MNIST training dataset. It defines the training loop and implements the necessary steps to optimize the model's parameters.

4. `evaluate.py`: This file contains code to evaluate the trained model on the MNIST test dataset. It computes the accuracy of the model in classifying the digits in the test set.

5. `main.py`: This file serves as the entry point to the code. It provides a command-line interface for training and evaluating the model. It allows you to specify hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and the number of training epochs, and choose between training or evaluating the model.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Download the MNIST dataset from the official website and place it in the appropriate directory.

2. Make sure you have Python 3.x and the required dependencies installed. You can install the dependencies by running the following command:

3. Modify the hyperparameters in `main.py` if desired. You can adjust parameters such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

4. To train the model, run the following command:

   The trained model will be saved to disk after the training is complete.

5. To evaluate the model on the test set, run the following command:

   The code will load the saved model from disk and compute the accuracy on the test set.
